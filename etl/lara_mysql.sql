("1","Application of real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) technology to cell-based assays","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15357917","Label-free detection emerges as a new approach in the development of technologies for cell-based screening assays. Unlike the classic detection methods that use fluorescence, radioisotope, luminescence, or light absorption, label-free detection directly measures the cell function without using a labeled molecule. The advantages of label-free detection include a simple homogeneous assay format, noninvasive measurement, less interference with normal cell function, kinetic measurement, and reduced time for assay development. Here, we have applied the electrical impedance detection method in a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES trade mark ) system for cell-based assays. The cell growth rate measured by this RT-CES system was comparable to actual cell number counted manually. In addition, cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, cytoprotection, cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis data generated by this RT-CES system correlated with those determined by the classic methods. The conclusion is that the RT-CES system is a useful tool for label-free detection of certain cell-based parameters.","Kelli Solly~Xiaobo Wang~Xiao Xu~Berta Strulovici~Wei Zheng","ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies","2004/01/06","Cancer Research","A549","","102959-100, 102959-100","Lung cancer cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Human","Purchased from ATCC","Not Specified","Not Specified","DMEM","Not Specified","","English"),
("2","Label-free, real-time monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell activation on microelectronic cell sensor arrays","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15350524","Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated mast cell activation is involved in the immediate phase of allergic reactions and plays a central role in the onslaught and persistence of allergic diseases. IgE-mediated mast cell activation includes two important events: cell sensitization resulting from IgE binding to Fc (FcepsilonRI) receptor and cell activation triggered by allergen-mediated oligomerization of membrane-bound IgE. Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation. Existing technologies are limited to label-based end-point assay formats, which detect either early signaling or final phase of mast cell activation. We describe a microelectronic cell sensor-based technology allowing dynamic monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell sensitization and activation in real-time without any labeling steps. RBL-2H3 mast cells were cultured onto the surface of microelectronic cell sensor arrays integrated into the bottom of microtiter plates, which record electric properties, such as impedance between cell membrane and sensor surface. In the presence of the allergen, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin (BSA), anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells were activated within 5 min and the entire activation process was quantitatively and continuously recorded. Impedance measurements correlate with morphological dynamics and mediator release as measured by beta-hexosaminidase activity, and can be blocked by pharmacological agents, inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling. The assay on microelectronic cell sensor arrays can be scaled up for high-throughput screening of pharmacological inhibitors of IgE-mediated mast cell activation and other cell-based receptor-ligand assays.","Yama A.

("3","The ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2B subcellular localization and functional importance for DNA replication in physiological growth of KB cells","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16168962","Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase (EC 1.17.4.1) (RR) is a potential target for antineoplastic agents due to its crucial role in DNA replication and repair. The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions. Thus, our findings suggested that M2B might play an important role for initiating DNA replication of KB cells in normal growth.","Xiyong Liu~Bingsen Zhou~Lijun Xue~Jennifer Shih~Karen Tye~Christina Qi~Yun Yen","Biochemical Pharmacology","2005/03/08","Immunology Research","T-cells","","","T-cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Not Specified","4.0x10^6 cells/well","Cell Tak","DMEM","1.5 uM","","English"),

Cells were grown onto the surfaces of microelectronic sensors, which are comprised of circle-on-line electrode arrays and are integrated into the bottom surfaces of the microtiter plate. Changes in cell status such as cell number, viability, morphology, and adherence were monitored and quantified by detecting sensor electrical impedance. For cell quantification and viability measurement, the data generated on the RT-CES system correlated well with those from the colorimetric (MTT) assay. For cytotoxicity assessment, cells growing on microelectronic sensors were treated with different cytotoxicants, such as arsenic, mercury, and sodium dichromate. The dynamic responses of the cells to the toxicants were continuously monitored by the RT-CES system. On the basis of the IC50 values, the RT-CES system displays an equal sensitivity to the neutral red uptake assay at specific time points. Furthermore, because the RT-CES system provides real-time information regarding the state of cell morphology and adhesion in addition to cell number, we were able to discern a previously unreported effect of arsenic on NIH 3T3 cells prior to cell death. Also, using the RT-CES system, we were able to monitor cytotoxicity effects that occur within a minute of compound addition. Taken together, the RT-CES system allows for real-time, continuous monitoring and quantitative recording of the whole assay process and provides new insight into the cell-toxicant interaction.","James Zan Xing~Lijun Zhu~Jo Ann Jackson~Stephan Gabos~Xue-Jun Sun~Xiao-bo Wang~and Xiao Xu","Chemical Research in Toxicology","2005/04/09","Neurobiology Research~Cell Metabolism in Screening","T-cells","","","T-cells","Fatty Acid Oxidation","Mouse","Not Specified","4.0x10^6 cells/well","Cell Tak","DMEM","1.5 uM","","English"),

In this report, the authors describe a label-free and real-time method for measuring and monitoring cell adhesion on special microplates integrated with electronic cell sensor arrays. These plates were used in conjunction with the real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system to dynamically and quantitatively monitor the specific interaction of fibroblasts with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and compared with standard adhesion techniques. Cell adhesion on ECM-coated cell sensor arrays is dependent on the concentration of ECM proteins coated and is inhibited by agents that disrupt the interaction of ECM with cell surface receptors. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for productive cell adhesion and spreading on ECM-coated microelectronic sensors. Confirming earlier results, it is shown that interfering with Src expression or activity, via siRNA or small molecule, results in the disruption of adhesion and spreading of Bx PC3 cells. The results indicate that the RT-CES system offers a convenient and quantitative means of assessing the kinetics of cell adhesion in a high-throughput manner.","Josephine M.

The RT-CES system was used to dynamically and quantitatively monitor NK-mediated cytotoxic activity towards 8 different adherent target cell lines, including cancer cell lines commonly used in laboratories. The cytotoxic activity monitored by RT-CES system was compared with standard techniques such as MTT measurement and shows good correlation and sensitivity. To test the specificity of the assay, pharmacological agents that inhibit NK cell degranulation and cytotoxic activity were employed and were shown to selectively and dose-dependently inhibit NK-mediated cytotoxic activity toward target cells. In summary, the RT-CES system offers fully automated measurement of cytotoxic activity in real time, which enables large-scale screening of chemical compounds or genes responsible for the regulation of NK-mediated cytotoxic activity.","Jenny Zhu~Xiaobo Wang~Xiao Xu~Yama A.

Efforts are underway to screen selective modulators of GPCRs and also to deorphanize GPCRs with unidentified natural ligands. Most GPCR-based cellular screens depend on labeling or recombinant expression of receptor or reporter proteins, which may not capture the true physiology or pharmacology of the GPCRs. In this paper, we describe a noninvasive and label-free assay for GPCRs that can be used with both engineered and nonengineered cell lines. The assay is based on using cell-electrode impedance to measure minute changes in cellular morphology as a result of ligand-dependent GPCR activation. We have used this technology to assay the functional activation of GPCRs coupled to different signaling pathways and have compared it to standard assays. We have used pharmacological modulators of GPCR signaling pathways to demonstrate the specificity of impedance-based measurements. Our data indicate that cell-electrode impedance measurements offer a convenient, sensitive, and quantitative method for assessing GPCR function. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of the readout offers the added advantage of performing multiple treatments in the same well to study events such as desensitization and receptor cross-talk.","Naichen Yu~Josephine M.

We have demonstrated that each cell type displays unique growth kinetic profiles that provide a quantitative account of cell behavior and can be used as a diagnostic tool for cellular quality control. The utility of the specific signature patterns was shown by demonstrating the significant differences in primary cell behavior depending on the supplier. In addition, the RT-CES system was able to differentiate cell behavior depending on the passage stage of the cells. The utility of the RT-CES system as an assay development tool was demonstrated in cytotoxicity assays. The RT-CES system not only provides information regarding the potency of cytotoxic compounds, but in addition relates potency to the rate of the response for each concentration of the compound tested, which is important for understanding the mechanism of compound action. Moreover, real-time display of cytotoxicity data by the RT-CES system allows for calculation of real-time 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values or determination of optimal IC(50) value. In summary, the RT-CES system provides high content and information-rich data that are beyond the scope of single-point assays.","Shelli L. Kirstein~Josephine M.

("9","Dynamic detection of natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cell adhesion by electrical impedance measurements","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17115926","Measurement of electrical impedance is a relatively new real-time and label-free method for monitoring cell adhesive properties. Impedance measurements are performed in tissue culture wells in which the bottom is equipped with gold electrodes. The extent of electrode coverage by living cells as well as the strength of the bond between the cell membrane and the electrode surface determines the impedance, which in real-time cell electrical sensing (RT-CES, ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA) is measured as the cell index (CI). We showed for carcinoma cells that CI was linearly correlated to the number of cells and that CI also was related to the amount of coating (laminin-5) of the wells. When natural killer (NK) cells were added to adherent carcinoma cells (target cells) CI declined rapidly dependent on the NK cell:target cell ratio. The initial decrease of CI was much more pronounced than target cell death as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Such a rapid fall of CI was due to changes in the adhesion and morphology of target cell undergoing apoptosis. It took more than 6 h before the extent of cell death and fall of CI were comparable. We also showed using A431 cells and an antibody specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Erbitux, manufactured by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) that RT-CES could be used to monitor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Thus RT-CES is a convenient way to continuously determine cell number and cell adhesion and may offer early detection of NK cell-mediated cytotoxic effects.","Joakim Glamann  Anker Jon Hansen","ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies","2006/09/04","Cell Metabolism in Technology","L9","","102959-100","Muscle cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Rat","","1.0x10^6 cell/well","Not Specified","","","","English"),

However, the mechanisms of the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior are unknown. In this study, we knocked down HDGF expression in NSCLC cells to determine the biological consequences. Transfection with HDGF-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in down-regulation of HDGF expression in four NSCLC cell lines. Down-regulation of HDGF resulted in no detectable effect on anchorage-dependent cell growth as determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a microelectronic cell sensor system, and flow cytometry. In contrast, cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA grew more slowly and formed significantly fewer colonies in soft agar than did cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or transfected with negative control siRNA. In an in vitro invasion assay, significantly fewer cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA than cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone were able to invade across a Matrigel membrane barrier. In an in vivo mouse model, A549 cells treated with HDGF-siRNA grown significantly slower than the cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or negative control siRNA. Morphologically, HDGF-siRNA-treated tumors exhibited markedly reduced blood vessel formation and increased necrosis, whereas the Ki67 labeling indices were similar in tumors treated with controls. Our results suggest that HDGF is involved in anchorage-independent growth, cell invasion, and formation of neovasculature of NSCLC. These qualities may contribute to the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior of NSCLC.","Jun Zhang~Hening Ren~Ping Yuan~","Cancer Research","2006/11/06","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","Whole embryo","","102959-100","Zebrafish","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Zebrafish","","4 embryos/well","Not Specified","","","","English"),

In this article, a label-free and real-time cell-based receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) assay that addresses limitation of existing kinase assays and can be used for high-throughput screening and lead optimization studies was validated and characterized. Using impedance, growth factor-induced morphological changes were quantitatively assessed in real time and used as a measure of RTK activity. COS7 cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin results in a rapid increase in cell impedance.

High glucose (27.8 mM) induced a decrease in transendothelial electrical impedance and an increase in cell monolayer permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier dysfunction stimulated by high glucose was accompanied by translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the redistribution of F-actin and formation of intercellular gaps, suggesting that increases in PKC activity and rearrangement of F-actin could be associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by acute high glucose. Application of astragaloside IV inhibited high glucose-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, which is compatible with inhibition of PKC translocation and improvement of F-actin rearrangements. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose-induced PKC alpha and beta2 overexpression in the membrane fraction were significantly reduced by astragaloside IV.

Ang-4 was discovered more recently; thus, its effect on angiogenesis and its interplay with other angiogenic factors have not been equivocally established. The role of Ang-4 in angiogenesis was tested in Matrigel chambers implanted into the subcutaneous space of nude mice. Ang-4 inhibited the angiogenic response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and GLC19 tumor cells. In Matrigel chambers with Ang-4-transfected cells, the mean response was significantly lower than that of mock cells. Subcutaneous tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was significantly lower in Ang-4-transfected GLC19 tumors than in mock-transfected tumors. IFP reduction in Ang-4-transfected tumors was comparable to the reduction seen after bevacizumab treatment. In vitro, we examined the effect of recombinant Ang-4 on endothelial cell migration in Boyden chambers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration induced by bFGF and VEGF was inhibited by Ang-4 to control levels.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, DeltaDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors.

We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances). These results suggest a critical role for CD55 to regulate iC3b and C5a release and in turn to influence the recruitment of beta-glucan-primed neutrophils eliciting killing activity.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a therapeutic target for DNA replication-dependent diseases such as cancer. Here, a potent small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex against the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) is developed and shown to reduce the growth potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 

Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. 

RESULTS: 

Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells. 

CONCLUSIONS: 

An anti-RRM2 siRNA duplex is identified that exhibits significant antiproliferative activity in cancer cells of varying human type and species (mouse, rat, monkey); these findings suggest that this duplex is a promising candidate for therapeutic development.","Jeremy D.

("21","Combination therapy targeting the tumor microenvironment is effective in a model of human ocular melanoma","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17640369","BACKGROUND: 

Ocular melanoma is the leading intraocular malignancy. There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. 

METHODS: 

Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. 

RESULTS: 

Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. 

CONCLUSION: 

Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases. Combining these agents works in an additive to synergistic way to inhibit the growth of tumors and development of metastases.","David P Mangiameli~Joseph A Blansfield~Stephan Kachala~Dominique Lorang~Peter H Schafer~George W Muller~David I Stirling  Steven K Libutti","Journal of Translational Medicine","2007/21/04","Cell Physiology Research","hESC","","","Stem cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Human","","3.0x10^4 cells/well","Geltrex","DMEM","1.5 uM","",""),

We show here that Shp2, an introcellular tyrosine phosphatase with two SH2 domains, plays a critical role in NSC activities. Conditional deletion of Shp2 in neural progenitor cells mediated by Nestin-Cre resulted in early postnatal lethality, impaired corticogenesis, and reduced proliferation of progenitor cells in the ventricular zone. In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~and Carol J.

To determine whether the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor and negative regulator during cell cycling, plays a role in the proliferation of cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs). 

METHODS: 

The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. 

RESULTS: 

The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. 

CONCLUSIONS: 

These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","Takeshi Joko~Daisuke Nanba~Fumio Shiba~Kazunori Miyata~Atsushi Shiraishi~Yuichi Ohashi~Shigeki Higashiyama","Molecular Vision","2007/24/07","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","MEF","","","Embryonic Fibroblasts","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Purchased from ATCC","2.0x10^4 cells/well","Gelatin (0.4%)","DMEM","","",""),

Here, we show a requirement for Gab2 in promoting mammary tumor metastasis. Although Gab2 expression levels were elevated in mammary tumors induced by the Neu (ErbB-2) oncogene, homozygous deletion of Gab2 in mice had only a modest effect on the initiation of Neu-induced mammary tumors. Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells. These findings suggest that although Gab2 overexpression may confer growth advantage to tumor cells, the functional requirement for Gab2 in mammary tumor initiation/growth may be dispensable, and that Gab2 may have a prominent role in promoting mammary tumor metastasis.","Y Ke~D Wu~F Princen~T Nguyen~Y Pang~J Lesperance~WJ Muller~RG Oshima  G-S Feng","Oncogene","2007/25/08","Cancer Research","iBMK","","","Kidney Cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","","2.3x10^4 cells/well","Not Specified","DMEM","","",""),

The method involves the use of microelectrode-embedded microwells seeded with one of two lung cancer carcinoma cell lines (A549 and SK-MES-1), allowing for continuous measurements of impedance. The change in impedance that is automatically converted to the cell index is linearly correlated with the numbers of the seeding cells during the log phase, providing quantitative measurement of cytotoxicity. After 24 h of initial incubation in 96 microwells, the cultures are treated with microparticles, and changes in the cell index are monitored in real time. Multiple data, including dose response curves, IC(50) (a concentration inhibiting 50% cell growth), and cell-specific and particulate-specific cell responses, are obtained from a single set of experiments. SK-MES-1 cells consistently showed more severe effects and lower IC(50) values than A549 cells when they were treated with quartz particle suspensions. The different effects detected using the RT-CES technique were related to morphological change and apoptosis, supported by the scanning electronic microscopy and flow cytometry results. The method is further used to test the cytotoxicity of two PM(10) standard reference materials of urban air dust and diesel particulates, demonstrating the potential application of this new technique for biomonitoring of air particulates.","Li Huang~Li Xie~Jessica M.

This technique uses three human cell lines (T24 bladder, HepG2 liver, and A549 lung carcinoma cells) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in parallel as the living components of the sensors of a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) method for dynamic monitoring of chemical toxicity. The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity. Four nitrosamines, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), were examined and unique cytotoxicity profiles were detected for each nitrosamine. In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction. Unlike etoposide, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas cleavage and apoptosis were not associated with increased levels of p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser(15)), a hallmark of genotoxic drug-induced p53 pathway activation. This is the first report of a potent selective PRL inhibitor that suppresses tumor cell three-dimensional growth by a novel mechanism involving p130Cas cleavage.

We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation.

The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions.

We have demonstrated that each cell type displays unique growth kinetic profiles that provide a quantitative account of cell behavior and can be used as a diagnostic tool for cellular quality control. The utility of the specific signature patterns was shown by demonstrating the significant differences in primary cell behavior depending on the supplier. In addition, the RT-CES system was able to differentiate cell behavior depending on the passage stage of the cells. The utility of the RT-CES system as an assay development tool was demonstrated in cytotoxicity assays. The RT-CES system not only provides information regarding the potency of cytotoxic compounds, but in addition relates potency to the rate of the response for each concentration of the compound tested, which is important for understanding the mechanism of compound action. Moreover, real-time display of cytotoxicity data by the RT-CES system allows for calculation of real-time 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values or determination of optimal IC(50) value. In summary, the RT-CES system provides high content and information-rich data that are beyond the scope of single-point assays.","Shelli L. Kirstein~Josephine M.

Impedance measurements are performed in tissue culture wells in which the bottom is equipped with gold electrodes. The extent of electrode coverage by living cells as well as the strength of the bond between the cell membrane and the electrode surface determines the impedance, which in real-time cell electrical sensing (RT-CES, ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA) is measured as the cell index (CI). We showed for carcinoma cells that CI was linearly correlated to the number of cells and that CI also was related to the amount of coating (laminin-5) of the wells. When natural killer (NK) cells were added to adherent carcinoma cells (target cells) CI declined rapidly dependent on the NK cell:target cell ratio. The initial decrease of CI was much more pronounced than target cell death as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Such a rapid fall of CI was due to changes in the adhesion and morphology of target cell undergoing apoptosis. It took more than 6 h before the extent of cell death and fall of CI were comparable. We also showed using A431 cells and an antibody specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Erbitux, manufactured by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) that RT-CES could be used to monitor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Thus RT-CES is a convenient way to continuously determine cell number and cell adhesion and may offer early detection of NK cell-mediated cytotoxic effects.","Joakim Glamann Anker Jon Hansen","ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies","2006/12/07","","MCF-7~A431 and SCC-25","ACEA RT-CES","","Hepatocytes","","","","","","","","",""),

However, the mechanisms of the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior are unknown. In this study, we knocked down HDGF expression in NSCLC cells to determine the biological consequences. Transfection with HDGF-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in down-regulation of HDGF expression in four NSCLC cell lines. Down-regulation of HDGF resulted in no detectable effect on anchorage-dependent cell growth as determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a microelectronic cell sensor system, and flow cytometry. In contrast, cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA grew more slowly and formed significantly fewer colonies in soft agar than did cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or transfected with negative control siRNA. In an in vitro invasion assay, significantly fewer cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA than cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone were able to invade across a Matrigel membrane barrier. In an in vivo mouse model, A549 cells treated with HDGF-siRNA grown significantly slower than the cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or negative control siRNA. Morphologically, HDGF-siRNA-treated tumors exhibited markedly reduced blood vessel formation and increased necrosis, whereas the Ki67 labeling indices were similar in tumors treated with controls. Our results suggest that HDGF is involved in anchorage-independent growth, cell invasion, and formation of neovasculature of NSCLC.

In this article, a label-free and real-time cell-based receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) assay that addresses limitation of existing kinase assays and can be used for high-throughput screening and lead optimization studies was validated and characterized. Using impedance, growth factor-induced morphological changes were quantitatively assessed in real time and used as a measure of RTK activity. COS7 cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin results in a rapid increase in cell impedance. Assessment of these growth factor-induced morphological changes and levels of receptor autophosphorylation using fluorescent microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, demonstrates that these changes correlate with changes in impedance. This assay was used to screen, identify, and characterize a potent EGF receptor inhibitor from a compound library.

High glucose (27.8 mM) induced a decrease in transendothelial electrical impedance and an increase in cell monolayer permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier dysfunction stimulated by high glucose was accompanied by translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the redistribution of F-actin and formation of intercellular gaps, suggesting that increases in PKC activity and rearrangement of F-actin could be associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by acute high glucose. Application of astragaloside IV inhibited high glucose-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, which is compatible with inhibition of PKC translocation and improvement of F-actin rearrangements. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose-induced PKC alpha and beta2 overexpression in the membrane fraction were significantly reduced by astragaloside IV. These findings indicate that astragaloside IV protected endothelial cells from high glucose-induced barrier impairment by inhibiting PKC activation, as well as improving cytoskeleton remodeling.","Han-Bing Li~Ya-Kun Ge~Le Zhang~Xiao-Xiang Zheng","Life Sciences","2006/16/11","","HUVEC","DP","","Hepatocytes","","","","","","","","",""),

Ang-4 was discovered more recently; thus, its effect on angiogenesis and its interplay with other angiogenic factors have not been equivocally established. The role of Ang-4 in angiogenesis was tested in Matrigel chambers implanted into the subcutaneous space of nude mice. Ang-4 inhibited the angiogenic response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and GLC19 tumor cells. In Matrigel chambers with Ang-4-transfected cells, the mean response was significantly lower than that of mock cells. Subcutaneous tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was significantly lower in Ang-4-transfected GLC19 tumors than in mock-transfected tumors. IFP reduction in Ang-4-transfected tumors was comparable to the reduction seen after bevacizumab treatment. In vitro, we examined the effect of recombinant Ang-4 on endothelial cell migration in Boyden chambers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration induced by bFGF and VEGF was inhibited by Ang-4 to control levels. In conclusion, we show that rhAng-4, as well as transfection with Ang-4, inhibits angiogenesis induced by GLC19 tumor cells and that Ang-4 expression reduces elevated tumor IFP.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, DeltaDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter. We conclude that promoter DNA methylation can be differentially regulated and DeltaDNMT3Bs are involved in regulation of such promoter-specific de novo DNA methylation.","Jie Wang~Manisha Bhutani~Ashutosh K.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances). These results suggest a critical role for CD55 to regulate iC3b and C5a release and in turn to influence the recruitment of beta-glucan-primed neutrophils eliciting killing activity.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

Here, a potent small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex against the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) is developed and shown to reduce the growth potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells.

There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. METHODS: Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases.

In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~Carol J.

METHODS: The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. RESULTS: The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","Takeshi Joko~Daisuke Nanba~Fumio Shiba~Kazunori Miyata~Atsushi Shiraishi~Yuichi Ohashi~Shigeki Higashiyama","Molecular Vision","2007/27/10","cofilin/ protein kinase D","Human corneal endothelial cells","ACEA RT-CES","","Hepatocytes","","","","","","","","",""),

Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells.

The change in impedance that is automatically converted to the cell index is linearly correlated with the numbers of the seeding cells during the log phase, providing quantitative measurement of cytotoxicity.

This technique uses three human cell lines (T24 bladder, HepG2 liver, and A549 lung carcinoma cells) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in parallel as the living components of the sensors of a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) method for dynamic monitoring of chemical toxicity. The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity. Four nitrosamines, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), were examined and unique cytotoxicity profiles were detected for each nitrosamine. In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest. This study demonstrates a new approach to comprehensive testing of chemical toxicity.","Jessica M.

One of the main hurdles in the cell-based assay field is to design sufficiently robust assays with adequate signal to noise parameters while maintaining the inherent physiology of the pathway or target being investigated. Conventional label and reporter-based cell assays may be more prone to artifacts due to considerable manipulation of the cell either by the label or over-expression of targets or reporter proteins. Cell-based label-free technologies preclude the need for cellular labeling or over-expression of reporter proteins, utilizing the inherent morphological and adhesive characteristics of the cell as a physiologically relevant and quantitative readout for various cellular assays. Furthermore, these technologies utilize non-invasive measurements allowing for time resolution and kinetics in the assay.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction. Unlike etoposide, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas cleavage and apoptosis were not associated with increased levels of p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser(15)), a hallmark of genotoxic drug-induced p53 pathway activation. This is the first report of a potent selective PRL inhibitor that suppresses tumor cell three-dimensional growth by a novel mechanism involving p130Cas cleavage. This study reveals a new insight into the role of PRL-3 in priming tumor progression and shows that PRL may represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.","Sherif Daouti~Wen-hui Li~Hong Qian","Cancer Research","2008/04/09","Methanolic extracts of Artemisia L. taxons","HeLa~RKO~HT-29~MDA-MB-435","ACEA RT-CIM","","Neuronal Cells","","","","","","","","",""),

We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

Identifying the requisite biopathways downstream of MYC may provide therapeutic opportunities. We used transcriptome analyses to show that MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas have coordinately deregulated myriad polyamine enzymes (including ODC1, SRM, SMS, AMD1, OAZ2, and SMOX) to enhance polyamine biosynthesis. High-risk tumors without MYCN amplification also overexpress ODC1, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, when compared with lower-risk tumors, suggesting that this pathway may be pivotal. Indeed, elevated ODC1 (independent of MYCN amplification) was associated with reduced survival in a large independent neuroblastoma cohort. As polyamines are essential for cell survival and linked to cancer progression, we studied polyamine antagonism to test for metabolic dependence on this pathway in neuroblastoma. The Odc inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibited neuroblast proliferation in vitro and suppressed oncogenesis in vivo. DFMO treatment of neuroblastoma-prone genetically engineered mice (TH-MYCN) extended tumor latency and survival in homozygous mice and prevented oncogenesis in hemizygous mice. In the latter, transient Odc ablation permanently prevented tumor onset consistent with a time-limited window for embryonal tumor initiation. Importantly, we show that DFMO augments antitumor efficacy of conventional cytotoxics in vivo. This work implicates polyamine biosynthesis as an arbiter of MYCN oncogenesis and shows initial efficacy for polyamine depletion strategies in neuroblastoma, a strategy that may have utility for this and other MYC-driven embryonal tumors.","Michael D.

We identified at least 7 transcription variants of deltaDNMT3B as a result of alternative pre-mRNA processing. The aim of this study was to detect the expression pattern of deltaDNMT3B variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the role of deltaDNMT3B variants in regulating the promoter-specific DNA methylation. METHODS: Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets were designed to distinguish individual deltaDNMT3B variants according to their splicing patterns. The expressions of seven deltaDNMT3B variants were measured in 13 cell lines, 109 NSCLC patients, and the corresponding normal lung tissues using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The status of the p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors was detected using a methylation specific PCR (MSP). The relationships of the expression patterns of the deltaDNMT3B variants were analyzed by observing the status of p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors. The siRNA and the anti-sense oligo-dioxynucleotide specifically targeting the junction of exon 5 and 7 of deltaDNMT3B were designed and transfected by lipofectmane 2000 into H1299 and H358 cell lines. RASSF1A promoter methylation from cells treated by siRNA-deltaDNMT3B4/2 was detected using MSP and Bisulfite sequencing, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of DNMT3B and ADNMT3B. Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were measured by applying real-time cell growth analysis and flowcytometry, respectively. RESULTS: ADNMT3B variants, not DNMT3B, were the predominant transcripts in both NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. The expression of deltaDNMT3B4 strongly correlated to the promoter methylation status of RASSF1A in a primary NSCLC. The knockdown of deltaDNMT3B4/2 by RNA-interference or anti-sense approaches resulted in a complete demethylation of RASSF1A promoter with the reactivation of a RASSF1A gene expression in less than 12 hours, but no effect resulted from the p16(INK4a) promoter in the NSCLC cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an important role of deltaDNMT3B4/2 in the maintenance of promoter-specific DNA methylation in a cell type specific manner and provide a novel cell model for the study of the regulation of replication-independent DNA methylation.","WANG Shu-hang~LIU Nin-hong~WANG Jie~BAI Hua MAO Li","Chinese Medical Journal","2008/07/02","","H522~H1792~H1299~SK-MES~H596~A549","ACEA RT-CES","","Kidney Cells","","","","","","","","",""),

Previous studies have shown that CNTO 95 exhibits both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities (Trikha M et al., Int J Cancer 110:326-335, 2004). In this study we investigated the biological activities of CNTO 95 on breast tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with CNTO 95 decreased the viability of breast tumor cells adhering to vitronectin. CNTO 95 inhibited tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in vitro. CNTO 95 treatment also induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the docking protein paxillin that recruits both structural and signaling molecules to focal adhesions (Turner CE, Int J Biochem Cell Biol 30:955-959, 1998; O'Neil GM et al., Trends Cell Biol 10:111-119, 2000). These results suggest that CNTO 95 inhibits breast tumor cell growth, migration and invasion by interruption of alphav integrin mediated focal adhesions and cell motility signals. In vivo studies of CNTO 95 were conducted in an orthotopic breast tumor xenograft model. Treatment with CNTO 95 resulted in significant inhibition of both tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells to the lungs. CNTO 95 also inhibited lung metastasis in a separate experimental (tail vein injection) model of metastasis.

Its proposed mechanism of action is independent of immune effector functions. Many human carcinomas not only secrete VEGF but also express membrane-bound VEGF. In addition, VEGF receptors are expressed on tumor cells. It is hypothesized that bevacizumab could bind membrane-bound VEGF or VEGF-VEGF receptor complexes on tumors, thereby initiating potential immunologic consequences. We previously showed that yeast-derived beta-glucan functions with antitumor antibodies that activate complement to recruit complement receptor 3-expressing leukocytes capable of mediating complement receptor 3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumors opsonized with iC3b. In the current study, the therapeutic efficacy mediated by combining bevacizumab with yeast-derived beta-glucan was studied in human carcinoma xenograft models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human tumor cell lines were screened for membrane-bound VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo. Complement activation mediated by bevacizumab was examined. Tumor cell lines positive or negative for membrane-bound VEGF expression were implanted in severe combined immunodeficient mice to establish xenograft models. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with different regimens. Tumor regression and long-term survival were recorded. RESULTS: Human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells expressed membrane-bound VEGF both in vitro and in vivo. Bevacizumab was bound to membrane-bound VEGF, activated complement, and synergized with beta-glucan to elicit cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo study showed that beta-glucan could significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy mediated by bevacizumab.

Such methods can be relatively expensive, low-throughput, and associated with pain suffered by the treated animals. In addition, differences in species biology may confound extrapolation to human health effects. OBJECTIVE: The National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center are collaborating to identify a battery of cell-based screens to prioritize compounds for further toxicologic evaluation. METHODS: A collection of 1,408 compounds previously tested in one or more traditional toxicologic assays were profiled for cytotoxicity using quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) in 13 human and rodent cell types derived from six common targets of xenobiotic toxicity (liver, blood, kidney, nerve, lung, skin). Selected cytotoxicants were further tested to define response kinetics. RESULTS: qHTS of these compounds produced robust and reproducible results, which allowed cross-compound, cross-cell type, and cross-species comparisons. Some compounds were cytotoxic to all cell types at similar concentrations, whereas others exhibited species- or cell type-specific cytotoxicity. Closely related cell types and analogous cell types in human and rodent frequently showed different patterns of cytotoxicity. Some compounds inducing similar levels of cytotoxicity showed distinct time dependence in kinetic studies, consistent with known mechanisms of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of high-quality cytotoxicity data on this large library of known compounds using qHTS demonstrates the potential of this methodology to profile a much broader array of assays and compounds, which, in aggregate, may be valuable for prioritizing compounds for further toxicologic evaluation, identifying compounds with particular mechanisms of action, and potentially predicting in vivo biological response.","Menghang Xia~Ruili Huang~Kristine L.

We have previously shown how elevated S100P levels in prostate cancer strongly correlate with progression to metastatic disease. In our study, we evaluated the functional significance of S100P expression on prostate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. S100P levels were modulated by overexpressing S100P in PC3 prostate cancer cells and by silencing S100P levels in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of S100P in PC3 cells promoted cell growth, increased the percentage of S-phase cells, decreased basal apoptosis rate and promoted anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells overexpressing S100P were protected against camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of S100P in 22Rv1 cells using siRNA resulted in a prominent cytostatic effect. The influence of S100P on tumor growth and metastases were assessed in vivo. S100P-overexpressing PC3 cells had a dramatically increased tumor formation compared to controls. Microarray analysis showed the involvement of growth pathways including increased androgen receptor expression in S100P-overexpressing cells. These results provide the first functional proof that S100P overexpression can upregulate androgen receptor expression and thereby promote prostate cancer progression by increasing cell growth. Moreover, the results confirm the oncogenic nature of S100P in prostate cancer and suggest that the protein may directly confer resistance to chemotherapy. Hence, S100P could be considered a potential drug target or a chemosensitization target, and could also serve as a biomarker for aggressive, hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancer.","Gargi D.

IgE-mediated mast cell activation includes two important events: cell sensitization resulting from IgE binding to Fc (FcepsilonRI) receptor and cell activation triggered by allergen-mediated oligomerization of membrane-bound IgE. Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation. Existing technologies are limited to label-based end-point assay formats, which detect either early signaling or final phase of mast cell activation. We describe a microelectronic cell sensor-based technology allowing dynamic monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell sensitization and activation in real-time without any labeling steps.

Impedance measurements correlate with morphological dynamics and mediator release as measured by beta-hexosaminidase activity, and can be blocked by pharmacological agents, inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling.

The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions. Thus, our findings suggested that M2B might play an important role for initiating DNA replication of KB cells in normal growth.","Xiyong Liu~Bingsen Zhou~Lijun Xue~Jennifer Shih~Karen Tye~Christina Qi~Yun Yen","Biochemical Pharmacology","2005/03/08","Immunology Research","T-cells","","","T-cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Not Specified","4.0x10^6 cells/well","Cell Tak","DMEM","1.5 uM","",""),

These plates were used in conjunction with the real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system to dynamically and quantitatively monitor the specific interaction of fibroblasts with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins and compared with standard adhesion techniques. Cell adhesion on ECM-coated cell sensor arrays is dependent on the concentration of ECM proteins coated and is inhibited by agents that disrupt the interaction of ECM with cell surface receptors. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is required for productive cell adhesion and spreading on ECM-coated microelectronic sensors. Confirming earlier results, it is shown that interfering with Src expression or activity, via siRNA or small molecule, results in the disruption of adhesion and spreading of Bx PC3 cells. The results indicate that the RT-CES system offers a convenient and quantitative means of assessing the kinetics of cell adhesion in a high-throughput manner.","Josephine M.

Efforts are underway to screen selective modulators of GPCRs and also to deorphanize GPCRs with unidentified natural ligands. Most GPCR-based cellular screens depend on labeling or recombinant expression of receptor or reporter proteins, which may not capture the true physiology or pharmacology of the GPCRs. In this paper, we describe a noninvasive and label-free assay for GPCRs that can be used with both engineered and nonengineered cell lines. The assay is based on using cell-electrode impedance to measure minute changes in cellular morphology as a result of ligand-dependent GPCR activation. We have used this technology to assay the functional activation of GPCRs coupled to different signaling pathways and have compared it to standard assays. We have used pharmacological modulators of GPCR signaling pathways to demonstrate the specificity of impedance-based measurements. Our data indicate that cell-electrode impedance measurements offer a convenient, sensitive, and quantitative method for assessing GPCR function. Moreover, the noninvasive nature of the readout offers the added advantage of performing multiple treatments in the same well to study events such as desensitization and receptor cross-talk.","Naichen Yu~Josephine M.

Impedance measurements are performed in tissue culture wells in which the bottom is equipped with gold electrodes. The extent of electrode coverage by living cells as well as the strength of the bond between the cell membrane and the electrode surface determines the impedance, which in real-time cell electrical sensing (RT-CES, ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA) is measured as the cell index (CI). We showed for carcinoma cells that CI was linearly correlated to the number of cells and that CI also was related to the amount of coating (laminin-5) of the wells. When natural killer (NK) cells were added to adherent carcinoma cells (target cells) CI declined rapidly dependent on the NK cell:target cell ratio. The initial decrease of CI was much more pronounced than target cell death as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Such a rapid fall of CI was due to changes in the adhesion and morphology of target cell undergoing apoptosis. It took more than 6 h before the extent of cell death and fall of CI were comparable. We also showed using A431 cells and an antibody specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Erbitux, manufactured by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) that RT-CES could be used to monitor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.

However, the mechanisms of the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior are unknown. In this study, we knocked down HDGF expression in NSCLC cells to determine the biological consequences. Transfection with HDGF-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in down-regulation of HDGF expression in four NSCLC cell lines. Down-regulation of HDGF resulted in no detectable effect on anchorage-dependent cell growth as determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a microelectronic cell sensor system, and flow cytometry. In contrast, cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA grew more slowly and formed significantly fewer colonies in soft agar than did cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or transfected with negative control siRNA. In an in vitro invasion assay, significantly fewer cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA than cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone were able to invade across a Matrigel membrane barrier. In an in vivo mouse model, A549 cells treated with HDGF-siRNA grown significantly slower than the cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or negative control siRNA. Morphologically, HDGF-siRNA-treated tumors exhibited markedly reduced blood vessel formation and increased necrosis, whereas the Ki67 labeling indices were similar in tumors treated with controls. Our results suggest that HDGF is involved in anchorage-independent growth, cell invasion, and formation of neovasculature of NSCLC.

High glucose (27.8 mM) induced a decrease in transendothelial electrical impedance and an increase in cell monolayer permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier dysfunction stimulated by high glucose was accompanied by translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the redistribution of F-actin and formation of intercellular gaps, suggesting that increases in PKC activity and rearrangement of F-actin could be associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by acute high glucose. Application of astragaloside IV inhibited high glucose-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, which is compatible with inhibition of PKC translocation and improvement of F-actin rearrangements. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose-induced PKC alpha and beta2 overexpression in the membrane fraction were significantly reduced by astragaloside IV.

Ang-4 inhibited the angiogenic response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and GLC19 tumor cells. In Matrigel chambers with Ang-4-transfected cells, the mean response was significantly lower than that of mock cells. Subcutaneous tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was significantly lower in Ang-4-transfected GLC19 tumors than in mock-transfected tumors.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances).

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 

Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. 

RESULTS: 

Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells.

Ocular melanoma is the leading intraocular malignancy. There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. 

METHODS: 

Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. 

RESULTS: 

Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. 

CONCLUSION: 

Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases. Combining these agents works in an additive to synergistic way to inhibit the growth of tumors and development of metastases.","David P Mangiameli~Joseph A Blansfield~Stephan Kachala~Dominique Lorang~Peter H Schafer~George W Muller~David I Stirling  Steven K Libutti","Journal of Translational Medicine","2007/21/04","Cell Physiology Research","hESC","","","Stem cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Human","","3.0x10^4 cells/well","Geltrex","DMEM","1.5 uM","",""),

In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~and Carol J.

To determine whether the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor and negative regulator during cell cycling, plays a role in the proliferation of cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs). 

METHODS: 

The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. 

RESULTS: 

The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. 

CONCLUSIONS: 

These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","Takeshi Joko~Daisuke Nanba~Fumio Shiba~Kazunori Miyata~Atsushi Shiraishi~Yuichi Ohashi~Shigeki Higashiyama","Molecular Vision","2007/24/07","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","MEF","","","Embryonic Fibroblasts","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Purchased from ATCC","2.0x10^4 cells/well","Gelatin (0.4%)","DMEM","","",""),

Here, we show a requirement for Gab2 in promoting mammary tumor metastasis. Although Gab2 expression levels were elevated in mammary tumors induced by the Neu (ErbB-2) oncogene, homozygous deletion of Gab2 in mice had only a modest effect on the initiation of Neu-induced mammary tumors. Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells. These findings suggest that although Gab2 overexpression may confer growth advantage to tumor cells, the functional requirement for Gab2 in mammary tumor initiation/growth may be dispensable, and that Gab2 may have a prominent role in promoting mammary tumor metastasis.","Y Ke~D Wu~F Princen~T Nguyen~Y Pang~J Lesperance~WJ Muller~RG Oshima  G-S Feng","Oncogene","2007/25/08","Cancer Research","iBMK","","","Kidney Cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","","2.3x10^4 cells/well","Not Specified","DMEM","","",""),

The method involves the use of microelectrode-embedded microwells seeded with one of two lung cancer carcinoma cell lines (A549 and SK-MES-1), allowing for continuous measurements of impedance. The change in impedance that is automatically converted to the cell index is linearly correlated with the numbers of the seeding cells during the log phase, providing quantitative measurement of cytotoxicity. After 24 h of initial incubation in 96 microwells, the cultures are treated with microparticles, and changes in the cell index are monitored in real time. Multiple data, including dose response curves, IC(50) (a concentration inhibiting 50% cell growth), and cell-specific and particulate-specific cell responses, are obtained from a single set of experiments. SK-MES-1 cells consistently showed more severe effects and lower IC(50) values than A549 cells when they were treated with quartz particle suspensions. The different effects detected using the RT-CES technique were related to morphological change and apoptosis, supported by the scanning electronic microscopy and flow cytometry results. The method is further used to test the cytotoxicity of two PM(10) standard reference materials of urban air dust and diesel particulates, demonstrating the potential application of this new technique for biomonitoring of air particulates.","Li Huang~Li Xie~Jessica M.

The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity. Four nitrosamines, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), were examined and unique cytotoxicity profiles were detected for each nitrosamine. In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest.

Conventional label and reporter-based cell assays may be more prone to artifacts due to considerable manipulation of the cell either by the label or over-expression of targets or reporter proteins. Cell-based label-free technologies preclude the need for cellular labeling or over-expression of reporter proteins, utilizing the inherent morphological and adhesive characteristics of the cell as a physiologically relevant and quantitative readout for various cellular assays.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction. Unlike etoposide, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas cleavage and apoptosis were not associated with increased levels of p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser(15)), a hallmark of genotoxic drug-induced p53 pathway activation. This is the first report of a potent selective PRL inhibitor that suppresses tumor cell three-dimensional growth by a novel mechanism involving p130Cas cleavage.

We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation. Existing technologies are limited to label-based end-point assay formats, which detect either early signaling or final phase of mast cell activation. We describe a microelectronic cell sensor-based technology allowing dynamic monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell sensitization and activation in real-time without any labeling steps. RBL-2H3 mast cells were cultured onto the surface of microelectronic cell sensor arrays integrated into the bottom of microtiter plates, which record electric properties, such as impedance between cell membrane and sensor surface. In the presence of the allergen, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin (BSA), anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells were activated within 5 min and the entire activation process was quantitatively and continuously recorded. Impedance measurements correlate with morphological dynamics and mediator release as measured by beta-hexosaminidase activity, and can be blocked by pharmacological agents, inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling.

The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions. Thus, our findings suggested that M2B might play an important role for initiating DNA replication of KB cells in normal growth.","Xiyong Liu~Bingsen Zhou~Lijun Xue~Jennifer Shih~Karen Tye~Christina Qi~Yun Yen","Biochemical Pharmacology","2005/06/11","","Human oropharyngeal epidermal carcinoma cell line KB","ACEA RT-CES","","Cellular Cardiology~Cytotox/ Cell Death~Receptor Activation","","","","","","","","",""),

COS7 cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin results in a rapid increase in cell impedance. Assessment of these growth factor-induced morphological changes and levels of receptor autophosphorylation using fluorescent microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, demonstrates that these changes correlate with changes in impedance. This assay was used to screen, identify, and characterize a potent EGF receptor inhibitor from a compound library. This report describes an assay that is simple in that it does not require intensive optimization or special reagents such as peptides, antibodies, or probes. More important, because the assay is cell based, the studies are done in a physiologically relevant environment, allowing for concurrent assessment of a compound's solubility, stability, membrane permeability, cytotoxicity, and off-target interaction effects.","Josephine M.

High glucose (27.8 mM) induced a decrease in transendothelial electrical impedance and an increase in cell monolayer permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier dysfunction stimulated by high glucose was accompanied by translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the redistribution of F-actin and formation of intercellular gaps, suggesting that increases in PKC activity and rearrangement of F-actin could be associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by acute high glucose. Application of astragaloside IV inhibited high glucose-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, which is compatible with inhibition of PKC translocation and improvement of F-actin rearrangements. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose-induced PKC alpha and beta2 overexpression in the membrane fraction were significantly reduced by astragaloside IV. These findings indicate that astragaloside IV protected endothelial cells from high glucose-induced barrier impairment by inhibiting PKC activation, as well as improving cytoskeleton remodeling.","Han-Bing Li~Ya-Kun Ge~Le Zhang~Xiao-Xiang Zheng","Life Sciences","2006/16/11","","HUVEC","DP","","Hepatocytes","","","","","","","","",""),

Ang-4 was discovered more recently; thus, its effect on angiogenesis and its interplay with other angiogenic factors have not been equivocally established. The role of Ang-4 in angiogenesis was tested in Matrigel chambers implanted into the subcutaneous space of nude mice. Ang-4 inhibited the angiogenic response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and GLC19 tumor cells. In Matrigel chambers with Ang-4-transfected cells, the mean response was significantly lower than that of mock cells. Subcutaneous tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was significantly lower in Ang-4-transfected GLC19 tumors than in mock-transfected tumors. IFP reduction in Ang-4-transfected tumors was comparable to the reduction seen after bevacizumab treatment. In vitro, we examined the effect of recombinant Ang-4 on endothelial cell migration in Boyden chambers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration induced by bFGF and VEGF was inhibited by Ang-4 to control levels. In conclusion, we show that rhAng-4, as well as transfection with Ang-4, inhibits angiogenesis induced by GLC19 tumor cells and that Ang-4 expression reduces elevated tumor IFP. In addition, we demonstrate that rhAng-4 inhibits HUVEC migration and growth factor-induced angiogenesis.","Minna W. B. Olsen~Carsten D. Ley~Nanna Junker~Anker J. Hanseny~Eva L. Lund Paul E. G.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, DeltaDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter. We conclude that promoter DNA methylation can be differentially regulated and DeltaDNMT3Bs are involved in regulation of such promoter-specific de novo DNA methylation.","Jie Wang~Manisha Bhutani~Ashutosh K.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances).

Here, a potent small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex against the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) is developed and shown to reduce the growth potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells.

There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. METHODS: Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases.

In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways. Together, these results identify Shp2 as a critical signaling molecule in coordinated regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal/astroglial cell differentiation.","Yuehai Ke~Eric E.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~Carol J.

METHODS: The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. RESULTS: The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF.

The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity.

In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro.

In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

Identifying the requisite biopathways downstream of MYC may provide therapeutic opportunities. We used transcriptome analyses to show that MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas have coordinately deregulated myriad polyamine enzymes (including ODC1, SRM, SMS, AMD1, OAZ2, and SMOX) to enhance polyamine biosynthesis. High-risk tumors without MYCN amplification also overexpress ODC1, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, when compared with lower-risk tumors, suggesting that this pathway may be pivotal. Indeed, elevated ODC1 (independent of MYCN amplification) was associated with reduced survival in a large independent neuroblastoma cohort. As polyamines are essential for cell survival and linked to cancer progression, we studied polyamine antagonism to test for metabolic dependence on this pathway in neuroblastoma. The Odc inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibited neuroblast proliferation in vitro and suppressed oncogenesis in vivo. DFMO treatment of neuroblastoma-prone genetically engineered mice (TH-MYCN) extended tumor latency and survival in homozygous mice and prevented oncogenesis in hemizygous mice. In the latter, transient Odc ablation permanently prevented tumor onset consistent with a time-limited window for embryonal tumor initiation. Importantly, we show that DFMO augments antitumor efficacy of conventional cytotoxics in vivo. This work implicates polyamine biosynthesis as an arbiter of MYCN oncogenesis and shows initial efficacy for polyamine depletion strategies in neuroblastoma, a strategy that may have utility for this and other MYC-driven embryonal tumors.","Michael D.

We identified at least 7 transcription variants of deltaDNMT3B as a result of alternative pre-mRNA processing. The aim of this study was to detect the expression pattern of deltaDNMT3B variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the role of deltaDNMT3B variants in regulating the promoter-specific DNA methylation. METHODS: Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets were designed to distinguish individual deltaDNMT3B variants according to their splicing patterns. The expressions of seven deltaDNMT3B variants were measured in 13 cell lines, 109 NSCLC patients, and the corresponding normal lung tissues using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The status of the p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors was detected using a methylation specific PCR (MSP). The relationships of the expression patterns of the deltaDNMT3B variants were analyzed by observing the status of p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors. The siRNA and the anti-sense oligo-dioxynucleotide specifically targeting the junction of exon 5 and 7 of deltaDNMT3B were designed and transfected by lipofectmane 2000 into H1299 and H358 cell lines. RASSF1A promoter methylation from cells treated by siRNA-deltaDNMT3B4/2 was detected using MSP and Bisulfite sequencing, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of DNMT3B and ADNMT3B. Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were measured by applying real-time cell growth analysis and flowcytometry, respectively. RESULTS: ADNMT3B variants, not DNMT3B, were the predominant transcripts in both NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. The expression of deltaDNMT3B4 strongly correlated to the promoter methylation status of RASSF1A in a primary NSCLC. The knockdown of deltaDNMT3B4/2 by RNA-interference or anti-sense approaches resulted in a complete demethylation of RASSF1A promoter with the reactivation of a RASSF1A gene expression in less than 12 hours, but no effect resulted from the p16(INK4a) promoter in the NSCLC cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate an important role of deltaDNMT3B4/2 in the maintenance of promoter-specific DNA methylation in a cell type specific manner and provide a novel cell model for the study of the regulation of replication-independent DNA methylation.","WANG Shu-hang~LIU Nin-hong~WANG Jie~BAI Hua MAO Li","Chinese Medical Journal","2008/07/02","","H522~H1792~H1299~SK-MES~H596~A549","ACEA RT-CES","","Kidney Cells","","","","","","","","",""),

Previous studies have shown that CNTO 95 exhibits both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities (Trikha M et al., Int J Cancer 110:326-335, 2004). In this study we investigated the biological activities of CNTO 95 on breast tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with CNTO 95 decreased the viability of breast tumor cells adhering to vitronectin. CNTO 95 inhibited tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in vitro. CNTO 95 treatment also induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the docking protein paxillin that recruits both structural and signaling molecules to focal adhesions (Turner CE, Int J Biochem Cell Biol 30:955-959, 1998; O'Neil GM et al., Trends Cell Biol 10:111-119, 2000). These results suggest that CNTO 95 inhibits breast tumor cell growth, migration and invasion by interruption of alphav integrin mediated focal adhesions and cell motility signals. In vivo studies of CNTO 95 were conducted in an orthotopic breast tumor xenograft model. Treatment with CNTO 95 resulted in significant inhibition of both tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells to the lungs. CNTO 95 also inhibited lung metastasis in a separate experimental (tail vein injection) model of metastasis. The results presented here demonstrate the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of CNTO 95 in breast cancer models and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating its inhibitory effects on metastasis.","Qiming Chen~Carol D.

Its proposed mechanism of action is independent of immune effector functions. Many human carcinomas not only secrete VEGF but also express membrane-bound VEGF. In addition, VEGF receptors are expressed on tumor cells. It is hypothesized that bevacizumab could bind membrane-bound VEGF or VEGF-VEGF receptor complexes on tumors, thereby initiating potential immunologic consequences. We previously showed that yeast-derived beta-glucan functions with antitumor antibodies that activate complement to recruit complement receptor 3-expressing leukocytes capable of mediating complement receptor 3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumors opsonized with iC3b. In the current study, the therapeutic efficacy mediated by combining bevacizumab with yeast-derived beta-glucan was studied in human carcinoma xenograft models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human tumor cell lines were screened for membrane-bound VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo. Complement activation mediated by bevacizumab was examined. Tumor cell lines positive or negative for membrane-bound VEGF expression were implanted in severe combined immunodeficient mice to establish xenograft models. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with different regimens. Tumor regression and long-term survival were recorded. RESULTS: Human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells expressed membrane-bound VEGF both in vitro and in vivo. Bevacizumab was bound to membrane-bound VEGF, activated complement, and synergized with beta-glucan to elicit cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo study showed that beta-glucan could significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy mediated by bevacizumab.

Such methods can be relatively expensive, low-throughput, and associated with pain suffered by the treated animals. In addition, differences in species biology may confound extrapolation to human health effects. OBJECTIVE: The National Toxicology Program and the National Institutes of Health Chemical Genomics Center are collaborating to identify a battery of cell-based screens to prioritize compounds for further toxicologic evaluation. METHODS: A collection of 1,408 compounds previously tested in one or more traditional toxicologic assays were profiled for cytotoxicity using quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) in 13 human and rodent cell types derived from six common targets of xenobiotic toxicity (liver, blood, kidney, nerve, lung, skin). Selected cytotoxicants were further tested to define response kinetics. RESULTS: qHTS of these compounds produced robust and reproducible results, which allowed cross-compound, cross-cell type, and cross-species comparisons. Some compounds were cytotoxic to all cell types at similar concentrations, whereas others exhibited species- or cell type-specific cytotoxicity. Closely related cell types and analogous cell types in human and rodent frequently showed different patterns of cytotoxicity. Some compounds inducing similar levels of cytotoxicity showed distinct time dependence in kinetic studies, consistent with known mechanisms of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The generation of high-quality cytotoxicity data on this large library of known compounds using qHTS demonstrates the potential of this methodology to profile a much broader array of assays and compounds, which, in aggregate, may be valuable for prioritizing compounds for further toxicologic evaluation, identifying compounds with particular mechanisms of action, and potentially predicting in vivo biological response.","Menghang Xia~Ruili Huang~Kristine L.

We have previously shown how elevated S100P levels in prostate cancer strongly correlate with progression to metastatic disease. In our study, we evaluated the functional significance of S100P expression on prostate tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. S100P levels were modulated by overexpressing S100P in PC3 prostate cancer cells and by silencing S100P levels in 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of S100P in PC3 cells promoted cell growth, increased the percentage of S-phase cells, decreased basal apoptosis rate and promoted anchorage independent growth in soft agar. Furthermore, prostate cancer cells overexpressing S100P were protected against camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of S100P in 22Rv1 cells using siRNA resulted in a prominent cytostatic effect. The influence of S100P on tumor growth and metastases were assessed in vivo. S100P-overexpressing PC3 cells had a dramatically increased tumor formation compared to controls. Microarray analysis showed the involvement of growth pathways including increased androgen receptor expression in S100P-overexpressing cells. These results provide the first functional proof that S100P overexpression can upregulate androgen receptor expression and thereby promote prostate cancer progression by increasing cell growth. Moreover, the results confirm the oncogenic nature of S100P in prostate cancer and suggest that the protein may directly confer resistance to chemotherapy. Hence, S100P could be considered a potential drug target or a chemosensitization target, and could also serve as a biomarker for aggressive, hormone-refractory and metastatic prostate cancer.","Gargi D.

IgE-mediated mast cell activation includes two important events: cell sensitization resulting from IgE binding to Fc (FcepsilonRI) receptor and cell activation triggered by allergen-mediated oligomerization of membrane-bound IgE. Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation. Existing technologies are limited to label-based end-point assay formats, which detect either early signaling or final phase of mast cell activation. We describe a microelectronic cell sensor-based technology allowing dynamic monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell sensitization and activation in real-time without any labeling steps. RBL-2H3 mast cells were cultured onto the surface of microelectronic cell sensor arrays integrated into the bottom of microtiter plates, which record electric properties, such as impedance between cell membrane and sensor surface. In the presence of the allergen, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin (BSA), anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells were activated within 5 min and the entire activation process was quantitatively and continuously recorded. Impedance measurements correlate with morphological dynamics and mediator release as measured by beta-hexosaminidase activity, and can be blocked by pharmacological agents, inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling.

The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions. Thus, our findings suggested that M2B might play an important role for initiating DNA replication of KB cells in normal growth.","Xiyong Liu~Bingsen Zhou~Lijun Xue~Jennifer Shih~Karen Tye~Christina Qi~Yun Yen","Biochemical Pharmacology","2005/03/08","Immunology Research","T-cells","","","T-cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Not Specified","4.0x10^6 cells/well","Cell Tak","DMEM","1.5 uM","",""),

We showed for carcinoma cells that CI was linearly correlated to the number of cells and that CI also was related to the amount of coating (laminin-5) of the wells. When natural killer (NK) cells were added to adherent carcinoma cells (target cells) CI declined rapidly dependent on the NK cell:target cell ratio. The initial decrease of CI was much more pronounced than target cell death as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. Such a rapid fall of CI was due to changes in the adhesion and morphology of target cell undergoing apoptosis. It took more than 6 h before the extent of cell death and fall of CI were comparable. We also showed using A431 cells and an antibody specific for the human epidermal growth factor receptor (Erbitux, manufactured by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) that RT-CES could be used to monitor antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Thus RT-CES is a convenient way to continuously determine cell number and cell adhesion and may offer early detection of NK cell-mediated cytotoxic effects.","Joakim Glamann  Anker Jon Hansen","ASSAY and Drug Development Technologies","2006/09/04","Cell Metabolism in Technology","L9","","102959-100","Muscle cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Rat","","1.0x10^6 cell/well","Not Specified","","","",""),

However, the mechanisms of the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior are unknown. In this study, we knocked down HDGF expression in NSCLC cells to determine the biological consequences. Transfection with HDGF-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in down-regulation of HDGF expression in four NSCLC cell lines. Down-regulation of HDGF resulted in no detectable effect on anchorage-dependent cell growth as determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, a microelectronic cell sensor system, and flow cytometry. In contrast, cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA grew more slowly and formed significantly fewer colonies in soft agar than did cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or transfected with negative control siRNA. In an in vitro invasion assay, significantly fewer cells transfected with HDGF-siRNA than cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone were able to invade across a Matrigel membrane barrier. In an in vivo mouse model, A549 cells treated with HDGF-siRNA grown significantly slower than the cells treated with LipofectAMINE alone or negative control siRNA. Morphologically, HDGF-siRNA-treated tumors exhibited markedly reduced blood vessel formation and increased necrosis, whereas the Ki67 labeling indices were similar in tumors treated with controls. Our results suggest that HDGF is involved in anchorage-independent growth, cell invasion, and formation of neovasculature of NSCLC. These qualities may contribute to the HDGF-associated aggressive biological behavior of NSCLC.","Jun Zhang~Hening Ren~Ping Yuan~","Cancer Research","2006/11/06","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","Whole embryo","","102959-100","Zebrafish","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Zebrafish","","4 embryos/well","Not Specified","","","",""),

In this article, a label-free and real-time cell-based receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) assay that addresses limitation of existing kinase assays and can be used for high-throughput screening and lead optimization studies was validated and characterized. Using impedance, growth factor-induced morphological changes were quantitatively assessed in real time and used as a measure of RTK activity. COS7 cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin results in a rapid increase in cell impedance. Assessment of these growth factor-induced morphological changes and levels of receptor autophosphorylation using fluorescent microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, demonstrates that these changes correlate with changes in impedance. This assay was used to screen, identify, and characterize a potent EGF receptor inhibitor from a compound library.

High glucose (27.8 mM) induced a decrease in transendothelial electrical impedance and an increase in cell monolayer permeability in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial barrier dysfunction stimulated by high glucose was accompanied by translocation and activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the redistribution of F-actin and formation of intercellular gaps, suggesting that increases in PKC activity and rearrangement of F-actin could be associated with endothelial barrier dysfunction induced by acute high glucose. Application of astragaloside IV inhibited high glucose-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner, which is compatible with inhibition of PKC translocation and improvement of F-actin rearrangements. Western blot analysis revealed that high glucose-induced PKC alpha and beta2 overexpression in the membrane fraction were significantly reduced by astragaloside IV. These findings indicate that astragaloside IV protected endothelial cells from high glucose-induced barrier impairment by inhibiting PKC activation, as well as improving cytoskeleton remodeling.","Han-Bing Li~Ya-Kun Ge~Le Zhang~Xiao-Xiang Zheng","Life Sciences","2006/13/08","Cell Metabolism in Screening","RPTC","","","Kidney Cells","Glucose Utilization","Rabbit","","4.0x10^4 cells/well","Not Specified","","","",""),

Ang-4 was discovered more recently; thus, its effect on angiogenesis and its interplay with other angiogenic factors have not been equivocally established. The role of Ang-4 in angiogenesis was tested in Matrigel chambers implanted into the subcutaneous space of nude mice. Ang-4 inhibited the angiogenic response of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and GLC19 tumor cells. In Matrigel chambers with Ang-4-transfected cells, the mean response was significantly lower than that of mock cells. Subcutaneous tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) was significantly lower in Ang-4-transfected GLC19 tumors than in mock-transfected tumors. IFP reduction in Ang-4-transfected tumors was comparable to the reduction seen after bevacizumab treatment. In vitro, we examined the effect of recombinant Ang-4 on endothelial cell migration in Boyden chambers. Human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration induced by bFGF and VEGF was inhibited by Ang-4 to control levels. In conclusion, we show that rhAng-4, as well as transfection with Ang-4, inhibits angiogenesis induced by GLC19 tumor cells and that Ang-4 expression reduces elevated tumor IFP.

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms.

We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, DeltaDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances). These results suggest a critical role for CD55 to regulate iC3b and C5a release and in turn to influence the recruitment of beta-glucan-primed neutrophils eliciting killing activity.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) is a therapeutic target for DNA replication-dependent diseases such as cancer. Here, a potent small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex against the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) is developed and shown to reduce the growth potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. 

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 

Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. 

RESULTS: 

Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells. 

CONCLUSIONS: 

An anti-RRM2 siRNA duplex is identified that exhibits significant antiproliferative activity in cancer cells of varying human type and species (mouse, rat, monkey); these findings suggest that this duplex is a promising candidate for therapeutic development.","Jeremy D.

Ocular melanoma is the leading intraocular malignancy. There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. 

METHODS: 

Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. 

RESULTS: 

Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. 

CONCLUSION: 

Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases. Combining these agents works in an additive to synergistic way to inhibit the growth of tumors and development of metastases.","David P Mangiameli~Joseph A Blansfield~Stephan Kachala~Dominique Lorang~Peter H Schafer~George W Muller~David I Stirling  Steven K Libutti","Journal of Translational Medicine","2007/21/04","Cell Physiology Research","hESC","","","Stem cells","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Human","","3.0x10^4 cells/well","Geltrex","DMEM","1.5 uM","",""),

In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways. Together, these results identify Shp2 as a critical signaling molecule in coordinated regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal/astroglial cell differentiation.","Yuehai Ke~Eric E.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~and Carol J.

To determine whether the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein, a transcriptional repressor and negative regulator during cell cycling, plays a role in the proliferation of cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs). 

METHODS: 

The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. 

RESULTS: 

The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. 

CONCLUSIONS: 

These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","Takeshi Joko~Daisuke Nanba~Fumio Shiba~Kazunori Miyata~Atsushi Shiraishi~Yuichi Ohashi~Shigeki Higashiyama","Molecular Vision","2007/24/07","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","MEF","","","Embryonic Fibroblasts","Cell Mitochondrial Stress Test","Mouse","Purchased from ATCC","2.0x10^4 cells/well","Gelatin (0.4%)","DMEM","","",""),

Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells.

This technique uses three human cell lines (T24 bladder, HepG2 liver, and A549 lung carcinoma cells) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells in parallel as the living components of the sensors of a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) method for dynamic monitoring of chemical toxicity. The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity. Four nitrosamines, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), were examined and unique cytotoxicity profiles were detected for each nitrosamine. In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest. This study demonstrates a new approach to comprehensive testing of chemical toxicity.","Jessica M.

One of the main hurdles in the cell-based assay field is to design sufficiently robust assays with adequate signal to noise parameters while maintaining the inherent physiology of the pathway or target being investigated. Conventional label and reporter-based cell assays may be more prone to artifacts due to considerable manipulation of the cell either by the label or over-expression of targets or reporter proteins. Cell-based label-free technologies preclude the need for cellular labeling or over-expression of reporter proteins, utilizing the inherent morphological and adhesive characteristics of the cell as a physiologically relevant and quantitative readout for various cellular assays. Furthermore, these technologies utilize non-invasive measurements allowing for time resolution and kinetics in the assay. In this article, we have reviewed the various label-free technologies that are being used in drug discovery settings and have focused our discussion on impedance-based label-free technologies and its main applications in drug discovery.","Biao Xi~Naichen Yu~Xiaobo Wang~Xiao Xu  Yama A.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction. Unlike etoposide, thienopyridone-induced p130Cas cleavage and apoptosis were not associated with increased levels of p53 and phospho-p53 (Ser(15)), a hallmark of genotoxic drug-induced p53 pathway activation. This is the first report of a potent selective PRL inhibitor that suppresses tumor cell three-dimensional growth by a novel mechanism involving p130Cas cleavage. This study reveals a new insight into the role of PRL-3 in priming tumor progression and shows that PRL may represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in cancer.","Sherif Daouti~Wen-hui Li~Hong Qian","Cancer Research","2008/01/06","Obesity, Diabetes, & Metabolic Disorders","Hepatocytes","","","Hepatocytes","Basal Metabolic Assay","Mouse","Obtained from ATCC","3.0x10^4 cells/well","Not Specified","","","",""),

We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

IgE-mediated mast cell activation includes two important events: cell sensitization resulting from IgE binding to Fc (FcepsilonRI) receptor and cell activation triggered by allergen-mediated oligomerization of membrane-bound IgE. Real-time monitoring of these events is needed to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying IgE-mediated mast cell activation. Existing technologies are limited to label-based end-point assay formats, which detect either early signaling or final phase of mast cell activation. We describe a microelectronic cell sensor-based technology allowing dynamic monitoring of IgE-mediated mast cell sensitization and activation in real-time without any labeling steps. RBL-2H3 mast cells were cultured onto the surface of microelectronic cell sensor arrays integrated into the bottom of microtiter plates, which record electric properties, such as impedance between cell membrane and sensor surface. In the presence of the allergen, dinitrophenyl (DNP)-bovine serum albumin (BSA), anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells were activated within 5 min and the entire activation process was quantitatively and continuously recorded. Impedance measurements correlate with morphological dynamics and mediator release as measured by beta-hexosaminidase activity, and can be blocked by pharmacological agents, inhibiting IgE-mediated signaling.

The expression and activity of RR subunits are highly regulated to maintain an optimal dNTP pool, which is required to maintain genetic fidelity. The human RR small subunit M2B (p53R2) is thought to contribute to DNA repair in response to DNA damage. However, it is not clear whether M2B is involved in providing dNTPs for DNA replication under physiological growth conditions. Serum starvation synchronized studies showed that a rapid increase of M2B was associated with cyclin E, which is responsible for regulation of G(1)/S-phase transition. A living cell sorting study that used KB cells in normal growth, further confirmed that M2B increased to maximum levels at the G(1)/S-phase transition, and decreased with DNA synthesis. Confocal studies revealed that M2B redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus earlier than hRRM2 in response to DNA replication. Nuclear accumulation of M2B is associated with dynamic changes in dNTP at early periods of serum addition. By using M2B-shRNA expression vectors, inhibition of M2B may result in growth retardation in KB cells. We conclude that M2B may translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and allow dNTPs to initiate DNA synthesis in KB cells under physiological conditions. Thus, our findings suggested that M2B might play an important role for initiating DNA replication of KB cells in normal growth.","Xiyong Liu~Bingsen Zhou~Lijun Xue~Jennifer Shih~Karen Tye~Christina Qi~Yun Yen","Biochemical Pharmacology","2005/06/11","","Human oropharyngeal epidermal carcinoma cell line KB","ACEA RT-CES","","Cellular Cardiology~Cytotox/ Cell Death~Receptor Activation","","","","","","","","",""),

Therefore, there is a need for agents that might amplify the effectiveness of these mAbs. One such agent is beta-glucan, a polysaccharide produced by fungi, yeast, and grains, but not mammalian cells. Beta-glucans are bound by C receptor 3 (CR3) and, in concert with target-associated complement fragment iC3b, elicit phagocytosis and killing of yeast. Beta-glucans may also promote killing of iC3b-opsonized tumor cells engendered by administration of anti-tumor mAbs. In this study, we report that tumor-bearing mice treated with a combination of beta-glucan and an anti-tumor mAb show almost complete cessation of tumor growth. This activity evidently derives from a 25-kDa fragment of beta-glucan released by macrophage processing of the parent polysaccharide. This fragment, but not parent beta-glucan, binds to neutrophil CR3, induces CBRM 1/5 neoepitope expression, and elicits CR3-dependent cytotoxicity. These events require phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase, Syk, and consequent PI3K activation because beta-glucan-mediated CR3-dependent cytotoxicity is greatly decreased by inhibition of these signaling molecules. Thus, beta-glucan enhances tumor killing through a cascade of events, including in vivo macrophage cleavage of the polysaccharide, dual CR3 ligation, and CR3-Syk-PI3K signaling. These results are important inasmuch as beta-glucan, an agent without evident toxicity, may be used to amplify tumor cell killing and may open new opportunities in the immunotherapy of cancer.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

The IC50 values and the LD50 values for the cytotoxicity reference materials were compared in the context of the proposed prediction model for acute rodent toxicity. The results obtained from RT-CES assay fitted within the acceptance limits of the prediction model and showed that the RT-CES cytotoxicity assay met the qualification guidelines in NIH Publication #01-4500 to accurately predict acute toxicity. In addition to cell viability, the RT-CES assay provided dynamic information that can be used to identify maximum toxicity and reversibility of the toxic effects which are difficult to achieve by the endpoint assays and, therefore, the RT-CES assay is more accurate for assessment of cytotoxicity. The features of the RT-CES assay, such as labeling free, automatic detection, and easy operation, give this assay potential to replace BALB/c 3T3 NRU assay and be used as routine setting for drug monitoring in the toxicological laboratory.","James Z.

PF-2341066 was identified as a potent, orally bioavailable, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase. PF-2341066 was selective for c-Met (and anaplastic lymphoma kinase) compared with a panel of >120 diverse tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited c-Met phosphorylation and c-Met-dependent proliferation, migration, or invasion of human tumor cells in vitro (IC(50) values, 5-20 nmol/L). In addition, PF-2341066 potently inhibited HGF-stimulated endothelial cell survival or invasion and serum-stimulated tubulogenesis in vitro, suggesting that this agent also exhibits antiangiogenic properties. PF-2341066 showed efficacy at well-tolerated doses, including marked cytoreductive antitumor activity, in several tumor models that expressed activated c-Met. The antitumor efficacy of PF-2341066 was dose dependent and showed a strong correlation to inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation in vivo. Near-maximal inhibition of c-Met activity for the full dosing interval was necessary to maximize the efficacy of PF-2341066. Additional mechanism-of-action studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Met-dependent signal transduction, tumor cell proliferation (Ki67), induction of apoptosis (caspase-3), and reduction of microvessel density (CD31). These results indicated that the antitumor activity of PF-2341066 may be mediated by direct effects on tumor cell growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic mechanisms. Collectively, these results show the therapeutic potential of targeting c-Met with selective small-molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers.","Helen Y. Zou~Qiuhua Li~Joseph H.

We recently reported the identification of a DNMT3B subfamily, DeltaDNMT3B, which contains at least seven variants, resulting from alternative pre-mRNA splicing. DeltaDNMT3Bs are the predominant expression forms of DNMT3B in human lung cancer. A strong correlation was observed between the promoter methylation of RASSF1A gene but not p16 gene (both frequently inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer) and expression of DeltaDNMT3B4 in primary lung cancer, suggesting a role of DeltaDNMT3B in regulating promoter-specific methylation of common tumor suppressor genes in tumorigenesis. In this report, we provide first experimental evidence showing a direct involvement of DeltaDNMT3B4 in regulating RASSF1A promoter methylation in human lung cancer cells. Knockdown of DeltaDNMT3B4 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in a rapid demethylation of RASSF1A promoter and reexpression of RASSF1A mRNA but had no effect on p16 promoter in the lung cancer cells. Conversely, normal bronchial epithelial cells with stably transfected DeltaDNMT3B4 gained an increased DNA methylation in RASSF1A promoter but not p16 promoter. We conclude that promoter DNA methylation can be differentially regulated and DeltaDNMT3Bs are involved in regulation of such promoter-specific de novo DNA methylation.","Jie Wang~Manisha Bhutani~Ashutosh K.

We have now tested this strategy using human carcinomas implanted in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Combined immunotherapy was therapeutically effective in vivo against NCI-H23 human non-small-cell lung carcinomas, but this modality was surprisingly ineffective against SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinomas. Whereas NCI-H23 tumors responded to this combination therapy with increased intratumoral neutrophil infiltration and C5a production, these responses were lacking in treated SKOV-3 tumors. Further results suggested that SKOV-3 tumors were protected by up-regulation of the membrane complement regulatory protein CD55 (decay-accelerating factor). Blockade of CD55 in vitro led to enhanced deposition of C activation product C3b and increased cytotoxicity mediated by beta-glucan-primed neutrophils. In vivo, administration of anti-CD55 mAb along with beta-glucan and anti-Her-2/neu mAb caused tumor regression and greatly improved long-term survival in animals bearing the previously resistant SKOV-3 tumors. This was accompanied by increased intratumoral neutrophil accumulation and C5a production. We conclude that CD55 suppresses tumor killing by antitumor mAb plus beta-glucan therapy (and, perhaps, in other circumstances). These results suggest a critical role for CD55 to regulate iC3b and C5a release and in turn to influence the recruitment of beta-glucan-primed neutrophils eliciting killing activity.","Bing Li~Daniel J.

Here, a potent small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex against the M2 subunit of RR (RRM2) is developed and shown to reduce the growth potential of cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Three anti-RRM2 siRNAs were identified via computational methods, and the potency of these and additional \"tiling\" duplexes was analyzed in cultured cells via cotransfections using a RRM2-luciferase fusion construct. Knockdown of RRM2 by the best duplex candidates was confirmed directly by Western blotting. The effect of potent duplexes on cell growth was investigated by a real-time cell electronic sensing assay. Finally, duplex performance was tested in vivo in luciferase-expressing cells via whole animal bioluminescence imaging. RESULTS: Moderate anti-RRM2 effects are observed from the three duplexes identified by computational methods. However, the tiling experiments yielded an extremely potent duplex (siR2B+5). This duplex achieves significant knockdown of RRM2 protein in cultured cells and has pronounced antiproliferative activity. S.c. tumors of cells that had been transfected with siR2B+5 preinjection grew slower than those of control cells. CONCLUSIONS: An anti-RRM2 siRNA duplex is identified that exhibits significant antiproliferative activity in cancer cells of varying human type and species (mouse, rat, monkey); these findings suggest that this duplex is a promising candidate for therapeutic development.","Jeremy D.

There is no effective treatment for metastatic ocular melanoma. We sought a treatment targeting the tumor microenvironment as well as the tumor cells. METHODS: Migration of HUVEC cells, the ability of HUVEC cells to form tubes, and proliferative capacity of a human ocular melanoma cell line were tested in the presence of lenalidomide and sorafenib alone and in combination. The compounds were also tested in a rat aortic ring assay and were tested in a highly aggressive human ocular melanoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Lenalidomide and Sorafenib inhibit HUVEC ability to migrate and form tubes and when used in combination the inhibition is increased. The agents alone and in combination inhibit outgrowth in the rat aortic ring model. The combination of the agents improved the inhibition over either single agent. In a xenograft model, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth over inhibition by single agent alone in a significant fashion (p < 0.004: lenalidomide and p < 0.0035: sorafenib). Furthermore, spontaneous lung metastasis development was completely inhibited in the combination treated animals. Sixty percent of vehicle treated animals developed lung metastases compared to 50% of lenalidomide treated animals, and 33% of sorafenib treated animals. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide and sorafenib are effective at targeting endothelial cells, inhibiting growth of ocular melanoma cells and can inhibit growth of tumors in a xenograft model as well as inhibit development of metastases.

In vitro analyses suggest that Shp2 mediates basic fibroblast growth factor signals in stimulating self-renewing proliferation of NSCs, partly through control of Bmi-1 expression. Furthermore, Shp2 regulates cell fate decisions, by promoting neurogenesis while suppressing astrogliogenesis, through reciprocal regulation of the Erk and Stat3 signaling pathways. Together, these results identify Shp2 as a critical signaling molecule in coordinated regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal/astroglial cell differentiation.","Yuehai Ke~Eric E.

In neuroblastoma tumors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor TrkB are associated with poor prognosis. Our previous studies have shown that BDNF activation of TrkB induces resistance to chemotherapy via activation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. To study targets of PI3K/Akt that mediate protection from chemotherapy, we focused on glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), which is a known modulator of apoptosis. We used pharmacologic and genetic methods to study the role of GSK-3beta in the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma from chemotherapy. BDNF activation of TrkB induced the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, resulting in its inactivation. Treatment of neuroblastoma cells with inhibitors of GSK-3beta, LiCl, GSK-3beta inhibitor VII, kenpaullone, or a GSK-3beta-targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in a 15% to 40% increase in neuroblastoma cell survival after cytotoxic treatment. Transfection of neuroblastoma cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta S9A9 caused a 10% to 15% decrease in cell survival. Using real-time, dynamic measurements of cell survival, we found that 6 to 8 h after etoposide treatment was the period during which critical events regulating the induction of cell death or BDNF/TrkB-induced protection occurred. During this period, etoposide treatment was associated with the dephosphorylation and activation of GSK-3beta in the mitochondria that was blocked by BDNF activation of TrkB. These data indicate that the inactivation of GSK-3beta contributes to the BDNF/TrkB/PI3K/Akt protection of neuroblastoma cells from chemotherapy.","Zhijie Li~Fei Tan~Carol J.

METHODS: The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. RESULTS: The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","Takeshi Joko~Daisuke Nanba~Fumio Shiba~Kazunori Miyata~Atsushi Shiraishi~Yuichi Ohashi~Shigeki Higashiyama","Molecular Vision","2007/27/10","cofilin/ protein kinase D","Human corneal endothelial cells","ACEA RT-CES","","Hepatocytes","","","","","","","","",""),

Although Gab2 expression levels were elevated in mammary tumors induced by the Neu (ErbB-2) oncogene, homozygous deletion of Gab2 in mice had only a modest effect on the initiation of Neu-induced mammary tumors. Notably, ablation of Gab2 severely suppressed lung metastasis. Gab2-deficient cancer cells displayed normal Akt activities, and their proliferative rate in vitro was similar to control cells. However, Gab2(-/-) cancer cells exhibited decreased migration and impaired Erk activation, and the defects were rescued by re-introduction of Gab2 into Gab2(-/-) cells.

The method involves the use of microelectrode-embedded microwells seeded with one of two lung cancer carcinoma cell lines (A549 and SK-MES-1), allowing for continuous measurements of impedance. The change in impedance that is automatically converted to the cell index is linearly correlated with the numbers of the seeding cells during the log phase, providing quantitative measurement of cytotoxicity. After 24 h of initial incubation in 96 microwells, the cultures are treated with microparticles, and changes in the cell index are monitored in real time. Multiple data, including dose response curves, IC(50) (a concentration inhibiting 50% cell growth), and cell-specific and particulate-specific cell responses, are obtained from a single set of experiments. SK-MES-1 cells consistently showed more severe effects and lower IC(50) values than A549 cells when they were treated with quartz particle suspensions.

The RT-CES technique measures changes in the impedance of individual microelectronic wells that is correlated linearly with changes in cell numbers during t log phase of cell growth, thus allowing determination of cytotoxicity. Four nitrosamines, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPhA), N-nitrosopiperidine (NPip), and N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPyr), were examined and unique cytotoxicity profiles were detected for each nitrosamine. In vitro cytotoxicity values (IC(50)) for NDPhA (ranging from 0.6 to 1.9 mM) were significantly lower than the IC(50) values for the well-known carcinogen NDMA (15-95 mM) in all four cell lines. T24 cells were the most sensitive to nitrosamine exposure among the four cell lines tested (T24>CHO>A549>HepG2), suggesting that T24 may serve as a new sensitive model for cytotoxicity screening. Cell staining results confirmed that administration of the IC(50) concentration from the RT-CES experiments inhibited cell growth by 50% compared to the controls, indicating that the RT-CES method provides reliable measures of IC(50). Staining and cell-cycle analysis confirmed that NDPhA caused cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, whereas NDMA did not disrupt the cell cycle but induced cell death, thus explaining the different cytotoxicity profiles detected by the RT-CES method. The parallel cytotoxicity profiling of nitrosamines on the four cell lines by the RT-CES method led to the discovery of the unique cytotoxicity of NDPhA causing cell-cycle arrest.

Aberrant overexpression of PRL-3 has been found in multiple solid tumor types. Ectopic expression of PRLs in cells induces transformation, increases mobility and invasiveness, and forms experimental metastases in mice. We have now shown that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of PRL expression in cancer cells results in the down-regulation of p130Cas phosphorylation and expression and prevents tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. We have also identified a small molecule, 7-amino-2-phenyl-5H-thieno[3,2-c]pyridin-4-one (thienopyridone), which potently and selectively inhibits all three PRLs but not other phosphatases in vitro. The thienopyridone showed significant inhibition of tumor cell anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, induction of the p130Cas cleavage, and anoikis, a type of apoptosis that can be induced by anticancer agents via disruption of cell-matrix interaction.

We show that overexpression of TSP1 in melanoma cells increases macrophage recruitment into xenograft tumors grown in nude or beige/nude mice. In vitro, TSP1 acutely induces expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) by monocytic cells, suggesting that TSP1-induced macrophage recruitment is at least partially mediated by PAI-1. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) can either promote or limit tumor progression. The percentage of M1-polarized macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase is increased in TSP1-expressing tumors. Furthermore, soluble TSP1 stimulates killing of breast carcinoma and melanoma cells by IFN-gamma-differentiated U937 cells in vitro via release of reactive oxygen species. TSP1 causes a significant increase in phorbol ester-mediated superoxide generation from differentiated monocytes by interaction with alpha(6)beta(1) integrin through its NH(2)-terminal region. The NH(2)-terminal domain of TSP2 also stimulates monocyte superoxide production. Extracellular calcium is required for the TSP1-induced macrophage respiratory burst. Thus, TSP1 may play an important role in antitumor immunity by enhancing recruitment and activation of M1 TAMs, which provides an additional selective pressure for loss of TSP1 and TSP2 expression during tumor progression.","Gema Martin-Manso~Susana Galli~Lisa A.

Identifying the requisite biopathways downstream of MYC may provide therapeutic opportunities. We used transcriptome analyses to show that MYCN-amplified neuroblastomas have coordinately deregulated myriad polyamine enzymes (including ODC1, SRM, SMS, AMD1, OAZ2, and SMOX) to enhance polyamine biosynthesis. High-risk tumors without MYCN amplification also overexpress ODC1, the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis, when compared with lower-risk tumors, suggesting that this pathway may be pivotal. Indeed, elevated ODC1 (independent of MYCN amplification) was associated with reduced survival in a large independent neuroblastoma cohort. As polyamines are essential for cell survival and linked to cancer progression, we studied polyamine antagonism to test for metabolic dependence on this pathway in neuroblastoma. The Odc inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) inhibited neuroblast proliferation in vitro and suppressed oncogenesis in vivo. DFMO treatment of neuroblastoma-prone genetically engineered mice (TH-MYCN) extended tumor latency and survival in homozygous mice and prevented oncogenesis in hemizygous mice. In the latter, transient Odc ablation permanently prevented tumor onset consistent with a time-limited window for embryonal tumor initiation. Importantly, we show that DFMO augments antitumor efficacy of conventional cytotoxics in vivo. This work implicates polyamine biosynthesis as an arbiter of MYCN oncogenesis and shows initial efficacy for polyamine depletion strategies in neuroblastoma, a strategy that may have utility for this and other MYC-driven embryonal tumors.","Michael D.

We identified at least 7 transcription variants of deltaDNMT3B as a result of alternative pre-mRNA processing. The aim of this study was to detect the expression pattern of deltaDNMT3B variants in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to explore the role of deltaDNMT3B variants in regulating the promoter-specific DNA methylation. METHODS: Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets were designed to distinguish individual deltaDNMT3B variants according to their splicing patterns. The expressions of seven deltaDNMT3B variants were measured in 13 cell lines, 109 NSCLC patients, and the corresponding normal lung tissues using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The status of the p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors was detected using a methylation specific PCR (MSP). The relationships of the expression patterns of the deltaDNMT3B variants were analyzed by observing the status of p16 and RASSF1A promoter methylations in the tumors. The siRNA and the anti-sense oligo-dioxynucleotide specifically targeting the junction of exon 5 and 7 of deltaDNMT3B were designed and transfected by lipofectmane 2000 into H1299 and H358 cell lines. RASSF1A promoter methylation from cells treated by siRNA-deltaDNMT3B4/2 was detected using MSP and Bisulfite sequencing, and Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression of DNMT3B and ADNMT3B. Cell growth and cell cycle distribution were measured by applying real-time cell growth analysis and flowcytometry, respectively. RESULTS: ADNMT3B variants, not DNMT3B, were the predominant transcripts in both NSCLC cell lines and primary tumors. The expression of deltaDNMT3B4 strongly correlated to the promoter methylation status of RASSF1A in a primary NSCLC. The knockdown of deltaDNMT3B4/2 by RNA-interference or anti-sense approaches resulted in a complete demethylation of RASSF1A promoter with the reactivation of a RASSF1A gene expression in less than 12 hours, but no effect resulted from the p16(INK4a) promoter in the NSCLC cell lines.

Previous studies have shown that CNTO 95 exhibits both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activities (Trikha M et al., Int J Cancer 110:326-335, 2004). In this study we investigated the biological activities of CNTO 95 on breast tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro treatment with CNTO 95 decreased the viability of breast tumor cells adhering to vitronectin. CNTO 95 inhibited tumor cell adhesion, migration, and invasion in vitro. CNTO 95 treatment also induced tyrosine dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and the docking protein paxillin that recruits both structural and signaling molecules to focal adhesions (Turner CE, Int J Biochem Cell Biol 30:955-959, 1998; O'Neil GM et al., Trends Cell Biol 10:111-119, 2000). These results suggest that CNTO 95 inhibits breast tumor cell growth, migration and invasion by interruption of alphav integrin mediated focal adhesions and cell motility signals. In vivo studies of CNTO 95 were conducted in an orthotopic breast tumor xenograft model. Treatment with CNTO 95 resulted in significant inhibition of both tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells to the lungs. CNTO 95 also inhibited lung metastasis in a separate experimental (tail vein injection) model of metastasis. The results presented here demonstrate the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of CNTO 95 in breast cancer models and provide insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating its inhibitory effects on metastasis.","Qiming Chen~Carol D.

("200","Yeast-Derived B-Glucan Augments the Therapeutic Efficacy Mediated by Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Monoclonal Antibody in Human Carcinoma Xenograft Models","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18281559","PURPOSE: Bevacizumab is a recombinant IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Its proposed mechanism of action is independent of immune effector functions. Many human carcinomas not only secrete VEGF but also express membrane-bound VEGF. In addition, VEGF receptors are expressed on tumor cells. It is hypothesized that bevacizumab could bind membrane-bound VEGF or VEGF-VEGF receptor complexes on tumors, thereby initiating potential immunologic consequences. We previously showed that yeast-derived beta-glucan functions with antitumor antibodies that activate complement to recruit complement receptor 3-expressing leukocytes capable of mediating complement receptor 3-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of tumors opsonized with iC3b. In the current study, the therapeutic efficacy mediated by combining bevacizumab with yeast-derived beta-glucan was studied in human carcinoma xenograft models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Human tumor cell lines were screened for membrane-bound VEGF expression both in vitro and in vivo. Complement activation mediated by bevacizumab was examined. Tumor cell lines positive or negative for membrane-bound VEGF expression were implanted in severe combined immunodeficient mice to establish xenograft models. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with different regimens. Tumor regression and long-term survival were recorded. RESULTS: Human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells expressed membrane-bound VEGF both in vitro and in vivo. Bevacizumab was bound to membrane-bound VEGF, activated complement, and synergized with beta-glucan to elicit cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo study showed that beta-glucan could significantly augment the therapeutic efficacy mediated by bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Yeast-derived beta-glucan can synergize with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab for the treatment of cancer with membrane-bound VEGF expression.","Carolina Salvador~Bing Li~Richard Hansen~Daniel E.
